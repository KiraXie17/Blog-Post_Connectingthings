The art of connecting things, is an interesting artistic practice to connect the real world with virtual world using computational technology. It's always interesting to see users interacting with the art pieces.

### Art Piece 1

The first art piece that I am interested in is called Interactive "Fur" Mirror.It is part of a new artworks exhibition at bitforms, New York. The artist, Daniel Rozin,uses motion sensors and 928 faux fur pom poms to create a mirror reflection of the viewer in real time. The "Fur" Mirror changes spontaneously when the viewers move. I like the material that Rozin used for this art piece; the fur texture reminds me of the distortion of reality, which is completely different from the mirror that we see in reality. Nevertheless, the "fur" mirror still reflects the function of mirror -- the reflection, which create an ambiguous illusion of the reality.

The Second artwork that I like is called Autonomous Drawing Robot, a series of graphic connectors created by Matthias Dorfelt. This is an autonouse drawing robot that draws graphic patterns generated by computational program. The thing that I like about this robot is that every graphic connectors are programed in a random and unique way, which seems to give the robot some independent agencies but in fact the connectors were all preset by Dorfelt. There is no limitation and no logic, which leaves open imagination for the viewers.
